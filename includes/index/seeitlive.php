                        content="Mazen Elbawab: I’m Mazen from Heddoko and what I’m going to show is
                                    our smart compression suit that captures the movement of the body
                                    for athletic performance tracking. I’m wearing actually underneath
                                    my coat to demonstrate that it is an undergarment that you can
                                    wear. And, strart the application.
                                Claudia Bacco: OK, I’ll zoom in on the app now.
                                Mazen Elbawab: Signing in. Connecting to the pairing with the garment.
                                Claudia Bacco: Ok and this is Bluetooth?
                                Mazen Elbawab: Yes. So it looks for the garment, connects to it.
                                    Now we start our training. We choose the sport of our choice.
                                    Basically what we have so far is golf, yoga, basketball, and
                                    cross-training. We choose the exercises that we’re up to.
                                Claudia Bacco: OK, and the choices there, they are ummm...
                                Mazen Elbawab: For this one, the only one working is the power squat.
                                    Everything else, we’re building up the database of our exercises
                                    as we go, so the number of exercises that you see here will be
                                    growing as the application will grow. The first screen, it shows
                                    a recorded movement with the suit, what the user is supposed to
                                    do. The second screen (I’ll just put it here.)
                                Claudia Bacco: And before you go to that, just to be clear, the
                                    recorded movement can either be your recorded movement or a
                                    recorded movement you aspire to be, correct?
                                Mazen Elbawab: Exactly. So either you take your own, personal
                                    recording to build up your muscle memory, or you take a
                                    researched “golden standard” that we have in our database. So
                                    now, I start training. I connect and you can see it’s tracking
                                    my movements.
                                Claudia Bacco: I can confirm that he’s really making these movements.
                                Mazen Elbawab:…Saying hi to the camera. Feet. Soccer kick. And after
                                    this, the last screen is not connected yet because I’m just
                                    showing the live movement, so what it’s supposed to do is take
                                    the golden standard for your recording, and compare it to what
                                    you just did, and give you a measure of accuracy of how far apart
                                    you are from the original recording. It tells you where the
                                    movement went wrong, where you can correct it, and to better
                                    your performance basically.
                                Claudia Bacco: And, the way I understand it, also, a trainer could
                                    set up a program for you where they want you to do specific
                                    things when you’re working out on your own, and then get that
                                    information and help you change it for the future?
                                Mazen Elbawab: Exactly. Coaches have two ways of using the application.
                                    First is, either they can record their own routines or choose
                                    their own routines and send it out to their athletes. The other
                                    way is we are building a web dashboard for them so they can
                                    access historical data for what their athletes did, so performance,
                                    risk of injury, if a specific athlete is repeating a faulty move
                                    over and over again, he risks an injury, like a chronic injury
                                    that comes back, like shoulder dislocations for example come from
                                    a faulty movement that you repeat over time, and they can prevent
                                    that before it happens – they can see that the athletes are doing
                                    the faulty movement. They can correct that before the injury
                                    actually happens.
                                Claudia Bacco: And what parts of the body are the sensors at?
                                Mazen Elbawab: They are tracking basically the torso and the limbs.
                                    Both thighs and calves and upper arm, forearm, and we have full
                                    torso movement with the hips and shoulders.
                                Claudia Bacco: OK great, thank you." />
