				<p data-animated="0">By bringing the power of 3D motion capture technology out of the lab and into the workplace, health and safety specialists can harness the data they need to inform workplace decisions, evaluate job requirements, and redesign work environments in a way that has never been done before to build a stronger, more efficient workforce. Every motion that is recorded is turned into actionable knowledge to ultimately help companies take care of the asset that matters the most â€“ their people.</p>
