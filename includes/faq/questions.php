						<strong>Can I access my data anywhere?</strong><br/>
						Yes. You can access your data through the cloud.<br/><br/>

						<strong>Does the app have learning capabilities?</strong><br/>
						Yes. Artificial intelligence allows the system to learn about your body
                        movements in order to provide insight on your technique to improve your
                        performance.<br/><br/>

						<strong>Am I able to set training goals?</strong><br/>
						Yes. In addition to guiding movement, the system is designed to be a
                        motivational tool as well, enabling you to set goals and monitor your
                        progress over time.

						<strong>How long does the battery last?</strong><br/>
						The battery allows for 4 hours of continuous motion capture.<br/><br/>

						<strong>When will it be available?</strong><br/>
						We are working hard to deliver our first versions of the garments in 2015.<br/><br/>

						<strong>How do I wash the garment?</strong><br/>
						Throw it in your washing machine! The garment is very durable and completely waterproof.  Just make sure it’s a cold wash and that you air-dry it before wearing.

						<strong>I’m a coach - can I monitor each athlete on my team simultaneously?</strong><br/>
						Yes. Using the Web Dashboard, you can monitor each athlete’s performance on
                        the team. The dashboard allows you to collect athlete analytics (both
                        individual and aggregated), and provides indicators so you can specifically
                        manage individual movement needs.<br/><br/>

						<strong>
                            Can I access information collected on my athletes away from the gym,
                            field, rink, or race track?
                        </strong><br/>
						Yes – you can access the Web Dashboard from anywhere through the cloud.<br/><br/>

                        <!--

						<strong>What does the garment track on my athletes?</strong><br/>
						The garment tracks a number of variables, including movement accuracy, joint
                        and limb position over time, speed of movement, force applied to the joints,
                        routine completion rate, and injury risk factor.<br/><br/>

                        -->

						<strong>What does the Web Dashboard display?</strong><br/>
						The Web Dashboard displays information including athlete profiles, recorded
                        movement data, and key performance metrics.

						<strong>How does the system recognize me?</strong><br/>
						Once you put on the motion capture suit, you will be guided through a set
                        of predefined poses in order to calibrate the system.<br/><br/>

						<strong>Does it take my prior or current injuries into account?</strong><br/>
						Yes. In addition to identifying underlying biomechanical issues that are
                        likely to result in injury, athletes who are injured can use Heddoko during
                        the rehabilitation process to monitor movement in order to optimize recovery.
                        <br/><br/>

						<strong>What type of coaching feedback does the system provide?</strong><br/>
						Heddoko provides both real-time audio and visual feedback to improve movement
                        precision and performance. Additionally, the garment is equipped with haptic
                        sensors that provide vibrational feedback to indicate correct/incorrect
                        movements.<br/><br/>

						<strong>How will the system help me to improve my performance?</strong><br/>
						Heddoko guides you towards moving more efficiently in real time by providing
                        annotations on the 3D model that articulate specifically what needs to be
                        adjusted. Additionally, our “ghost feature” allows you to track and record
                        your performance and compare yourself in real time either to a past
                        performance or a “gold standard” (i.e. an expert executing the same movement).
