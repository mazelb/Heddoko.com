			<p class="page-description">We collect full‐body biomechanics data, model that data in 3D, and let you view it in real‐time or save it for playback. With our applications, coaches and trainers can analyze the movements of athletes, track metrics over time, work with athletes to improve their biomechanics, use hard data to back rehabilitation and get athletes back in the game more efficiently, and assess risk of injury to improve how the athlete of tomorrow moves.</p>
