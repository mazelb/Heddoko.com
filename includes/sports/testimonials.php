			<p>I can see a lot of potential to use the Heddoko suit as a coaching tool while Iâ€™m coaching my athletes. Combined with live coaching cues from the coach, feedback from the Heddoko, could potentially aid the athlete to actually see clearly where changes in their movement patterns need to be made.</p>
