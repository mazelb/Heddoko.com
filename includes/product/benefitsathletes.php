                        be improved to help you run faster and jump higher? How is your movement

					<h4>Optimize rehabilitation</h4>

					<p>
					    Better understand your biomechanics to help prevent injuries before they
                        happen, and rehabilitate faster when they do. Determine the underlying
                        causes of injury. Record baseline measurements to track and compare movement
                        during recovery. Guide rehabilitation programs with objective movement data.
                        Decrease the time it takes to return to sport.

                        key areas that can be addressed to improve how you move? How consistent is
                        your technique? How have you progressed over time?

                        workouts, measure your improvement over time, and create benchmark targets.
                        How does your squat technique compare to one year ago? Has your running time
                        improved as your gait mechanics have become more efficient? Has your
                        training volume increased over time?
