				<p data-animated="0">
                    Everything we measure aims to answer a question: Are there key areas that can be addressed to improve how you move? How consistent is your technique? How is your movement affected by variables like fatigue or workspace design?<br><br>
                    Heddoko provides valuable metrics that help make workplaces safer and improve efficiency – from objective movement evaluations that identify risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders, to physical demands analyses for specific jobs tasks, to recording baseline standards that can be used for comparison if an employee is injured and returning to work.
