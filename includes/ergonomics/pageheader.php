			<p class="page-description">Heddoko uses sensors fully‐integrated in a compression suit to collect full‐body biomechanics data. That data is modelled in 3D and movements can be viewed in real‐time or can be saved to playback later. Using our applications, you can analyze movements, track metrics over time, and make comparisons to benchmarks or movement standards to improve how you move.</p>
