			<p class="page-description">We collect full‐body biomechanics data, model that data in 3D, and let you view it in real‐time or save it for playback. With our applications, ergonomists can analyze the movements of workers, track metrics over time, and make comparisons to benchmarks or movement standards to assess risk of injury and improve how the workforce moves.</p>
