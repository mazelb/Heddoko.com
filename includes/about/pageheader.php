                <p><em>Heddoko</em>, Japanese for head coach, was born a year ago from an idea at the precise intersection of sports, technology, and passion – in the mind of a software engineer training for a mixed martial arts (MMA) competition in a Montreal gym</p>
                <p>Rooted in the belief that it should be simpler to measure and understand human movement, we’ve made it out goal to provide all human beings with objective data that can be used to enact change</p>
                <p>Using what we’ve learned from sports as a foundation, we’ve applied the same principles – movement screening, performance analysis, and rehabilitation monitoring – to a broader industrial market and believe all workers should be treated as athletes</p>
                <h4>We are Heddoko. We translate data to information, information to knowledge, and knowledge to wisdom. We are a community of professionals committed to helping humans move better.</h4>
